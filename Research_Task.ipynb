    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "**Usability:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The system has to run smoothly and shall require administrator permission to run. This is because the program could be hacked to install malware/adware/viruses which would be bad for the user's computer. The README document will contain all text explaining that it is not a virus and that it will require the user's password in order to view the results of the analysis, similar to having to sign up in order to read further on some websites. After that it will display the interface where the graphs are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The system is required not to fail and should not fail as it requires the password of the user. This ensures that the program is reliable. The reliability of the information will depend on the accuracy of the file that is put in for analysis."

    "### Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "**Purpose:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The purpose of this analysis is to find out which Steam games are available on which platforms. This will be done by first sorting each game into different categories based on their available platforms. Games that are supported on multiple platforms will appear in all platforms supported. After this process is completed, the games are then sorted by the number of downloads. This will determine the most popular games on their platforms for all time. Then the downloads are sorted into each year, from most to least. An individual game's popularity graph should also be able to be viewed. To display this information, the plan is to use a GUI (TKinter) and have interactive graphs and buttons for navigation. Whether these games are free will also matter, so this can be sorted into most popular free games. The reason this is important is because humans are still pack animals, and therefore still prefer to conform with the crowd. This also applies when the subject shifts to video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing Data:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The reason this analysis is necessary is because there are many different websites that all show different imformation depending on what plaftorm they are basing it off of, and some of these websites do not even tell the viewers what platforms these games are for. The results that will be displayed in the program will not only show the most popular games for each platform temporarily, it will also be updated every time the most popular game changes. This way, gamers will rest assured that they can stick with the largest pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The information that us created will benefit anyone who plays or wants to play video games. This information allows content creators to create gaming content that appeals to the largest audience. This also confirms the most popular. This will also benefit the gaming industry as it helps developers understand what their customers want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use:** \\\n",
    "&nbsp; The information can be ued by those who benefit by it in multiple different ways depending on which type of beneficiary. The developers can benefit from this as it will help them understand which types of games are popular. Streamers and content creators will benefit from this as they will then have the knowledge of which games most people play and can create content based on that, providing them with more views. This also helps people interested in games find more content creators as many others will follow in the popular ones' footsteps."
